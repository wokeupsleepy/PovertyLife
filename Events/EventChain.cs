     * Input GameEvent (InputGameEventLink),
     * contains GameEvent collection (AvailableGameEventLinks),
     * needs to contain code that determines which GameEvents are available for player choice from AvailableGameEventLinks,
         * This can be a combination of probability and CharacterTrait, Stat, etc. checks
